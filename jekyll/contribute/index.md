To help this website grow and adapt to user needs, we are happy to take suggested updates and contributions from the community.

Here are some ways in which you might contribute:



*   suggest a new pattern that we could add to the catalogue
*   suggest an alternative name for an existing pattern
*   submit wording improvements to any of the existing site content, for example to improve the discussion around a specific pattern
*   submit new patterns for us to add to the catalogue, using the template below
*   submit other improvements to the website layout, e.g. to improve accessibility or readability
*   discussing changes submitted or suggested by others in [the github project](https://github.com/theodi/collaborative-data-patterns-catalogue).
*   send us feedback at [collaborative-maintenance@theodi.org](mailto:collaborative-maintenance@theodi.org) and tell us what you think of the pattern catalogue and whether you have used it in a project

You can make suggestions or submit content by [creating a github issue in the project](https://github.com/theodi/collaborative-data-patterns-catalogue/issues). Or by submitting a pull request if you are happy using git.

Feel free to also add to the discussion around a suggestion or submission by contributing to the discussion in [the list of submitted issues](https://github.com/theodi/collaborative-data-patterns-catalogue/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/theodi/collaborative-data-patterns-catalogue/pulls).


## Pattern Template

All of the patterns in this website use the following template. Use the structure and notes to help you write and submit new patterns.



*   **Problem**
    *   should be a statement, or possibly a question if a statement doesn’t work
    *   the problem statement should ‘describe the visible manifestation of something wrong’ and not presuppose the solution
*   **Context**
    *   explains when to use this pattern 
*   **Solution** 
    *   provides a solution that answers the problem
*   **Discussion** 
    *   provide more background and detail to the proposed solution
    *   a good discussion will introduce some of the underlying causes for the problem and may add more in-depth ideas around implementation of the solution
    *   the discussion might also address edge cases, outliers, or design trade-offs, for example when you might instead apply an alternative pattern
*   **Related patterns**
    *   a short list of related patterns, for example those that are essential to implementing the solution or offer useful variations

To help you draft your patterns, our recommendations are that



*   patterns should be approximately **300 words in length**
*   use **short sentences**, bullet points for lists, chunk the content, and make it skimmable
*   test the **fitness** of your proposed pattern by checking that the pattern is successful - ie solution matches problem
*   test the **usefulness** of your proposed pattern by checking that the pattern explains why it is successful and beneficial
*   **provide real world examples** so we can be sure it is an existing solution, not an idea
*   cross-reference other patterns and include their **names in bold** with hyperlinks
