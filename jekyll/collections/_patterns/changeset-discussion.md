An entry that makes a change to a database will often be reviewed by moderators.

If a moderator or contributor wants to discuss something about the change, provide feedback or show appreciation, it helps to contextualise the discussion if it can be held alongside the details of the specific entry.

The discussion can be either a single comment or a back-and-forth conversation.
