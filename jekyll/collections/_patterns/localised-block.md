description: >-
    A contributor is not adhering the project’s Published Policies, but this is only happening when contributing to a certain topic.
context: >-
    Some databases contain contentious topics that are prone to repeated contradictory edits (an ‘edit war’), or contain localised topics of interest that lend themselves to focused attention. The contributor in question will have ignored Warning Messages to stop disruptive or improper activities.
solution: >-

* You can ban a contributor from a certain topic and its related children topics if necessary.
* A related sanction might be to reverse previous contributions to the topic.
* Whatever the decision, it is vital to notify the contributor to inform them of the actions you are taking
* The ban can be permanent or temporary.
* * If it is temporary, there needs to be a way to reverse it
* Banning contributors is not trivial, it should be done in accordance with the **Project Policies**.
