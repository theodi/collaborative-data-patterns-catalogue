    There is a need for a Communal Database to support a diverse set of communities. But outside a common core set of data, there are different and evolving needs.
context: >-
    Given the right tools, a community can work together to maintain a Communal Database. Adapting to divergent needs can be difficult to manage from the centre. 
solution: >-
    Create a collaboratively maintained dataset that provides a shared data infrastructure for a community to coordinate around collecting data of interest and benefit to them.

Open knowledge can provide benefits to a wide range of stakeholders. A collaboratively maintained shared or open dataset can help to provide equitable access to data.

A Knowledge Commons project differs from a **Communal Database **in the degree to which work is shared across the community. Sharing not just maintenance work, but also the overall stewardship might help to build trust and sustainability.

Going beyond the maintenance work of a **Communal Database – **to create a data infrastructure that allows communities to be more directly involved in the work of stewarding data – can help to build trust, adapt to diverging needs, and  **Minimise Harm.**

A Knowledge Commons project will consist of a common core dataset that is enriched by different perspectives and data that support the needs of different, overlapping communities.

Unlike a **Communal Database** whose schema is likely to be more centrally managed, this type of project will likely involve a data model which is a **Shared Canvas** that is adapted and improved on by the community.

The project will likely involve a large, distributed community so **Know Your Community**,  **Encourage Interest Groups**, **Organise Campaigns** and **Build a Rhythm**.

With a diverse, distributed community, using **Escalating Blocking** to handle disputes and malicious entries will be essential.

The decentralised decision making of this type of project means that **Transparent Stewardship**, **Clearly Defined Roles** and **Visible Processes** are all vital. **Clear Licensing** will also be important to ensure that the community of contributors understand what rights they have over data collected by and about them.
