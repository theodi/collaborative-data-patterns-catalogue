problem: >-
    It can be unclear if an individual record has been reviewed or seen by other contributors
context: >-
    It can be difficult for contributors to understand whether an individual record has not been updated because it is correct or that it just hasn’t yet been checked by another user.

When there is visible activity around a record, e.g. through a **Track Changes** feature, contributors may feel more comfortable that the data is correct. The activity indicates that other contributors have looked at and improved the record over time.

In a large database there may be no recorded activity against some individual records. The lack of activity might be because the data is basically correct or the record is complete and so needs no further work. However the lack of activity might mean that it simply hasn’t received any attention so might still contain errors.

Without some indication that a record has been inspected, users may have lower confidence in the data or might needlessly spend time repeating work to validate the data.

Marking as Verified allows a contributor to indicate that a record has been checked but doesn’t currently need further work. It supports some basic workflow to help coordinate the work of contributors.

Marking as Verified is often used in contribution with Flag For Review to indicate that a review has taken place. The two patterns support one another.

Verification can be particularly useful where there is a need to cross-reference data against another primary source. For example the project might be cataloguing data about a book or business. Or users may be reporting bird sightings and including photographs of a bird and their identification. **Submitting Evidence** is a way for contributors to indicate the provenance of data, Marking as Verified can help to indicate that other contributors have checked that the sources or observations are correct.

Marking a record as verified could be considered one of the smallest useful contributions to the database. You could signpost contributors to these tasks as part of their **Learning Curve**.
