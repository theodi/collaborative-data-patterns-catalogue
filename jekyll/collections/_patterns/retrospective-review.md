In projects that do not require **Mandatory Review** to ensure data quality, you can instead equip your community with the tools to monitor and review recent changes themselves, for example:  

* Implement **Changesets** and uses them to allow contributors to **Revert Change** if they notice a mistake
* Use **Track Changes** to help contributors to see recent changes to records or the entire database
* Use **Watch List** to allow contributors to monitor areas of interest
* The latest version of a record should be **Visibly Editable** so that if a mistake is found, someone can either **Revert Changes** introduced in a particular changeset or make subsequent changes of their own
