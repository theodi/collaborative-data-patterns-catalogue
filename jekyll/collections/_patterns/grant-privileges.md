In any project there is usually a need to restrict certain features to a smaller group of privileged users. For example only project administrators might be able to apply a **Temporary Block** to a user account. Or the ability to apply a **Bulk Edit** might be limited to users that have shown they are capable of using the necessary tools with due care and attention. 

Role based access control is a common way to restrict features and abilities to specific user accounts. A project team can retain control over which users have specific roles by explicitly granting those rights through an administration tool.

It is important to have **Clearly Defined Roles** so both the project team and the community understand their responsibilities.

In large communities it might be helpful to allow users to **Automatically Acquire Privileges** to share work and responsibilities.
