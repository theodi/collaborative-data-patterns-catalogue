In any project there is usually a need to restrict certain features to a smaller group of privileged users. For example only project administrators might be able to apply a **[Temporary Block](/patterns/managing-conflict/temporary-block)** to a user account. Or the ability to apply a **[Bulk Changes](/patterns/workflow/bulk-changes)** might be limited to users that have shown they are capable of using the necessary tools with due care and attention.

Role based access control is a common way to restrict features and abilities to specific user accounts. A project team can retain control over which users have specific roles by explicitly granting those rights through an administration tool.

It is important to have **[Clearly Defined Roles](/patterns/project-governance/clearly-defined-roles)** so both the project team and the community understand their responsibilities.

In large communities it might be helpful to allow users to **[Automatically Acquire Privileges](/patterns/project-governance/automatically-acquire-privileges)** to share work and responsibilities.
