In some projects it will be possible to ‘complete’ a record, and once it has been verified and confirmed as the final version, no further changes should be allowed.

In other cases, a dispute may have been resolved according to the project’s **[Published Policy](/patterns/project-governance/published-policies)** and the administrator may want to lock the record to prevent any further disagreement or reversing of subsequent edits.

The lock on a record may be reversible under certain conditions, in which case it should be made clear how a contributor can **[Suggest Edits](/patterns/encouraging-contributions/suggested-edits)** or contact the administrator, according to the **[Published Policy](/patterns/project-governance/published-policies)**.

The entry’s history should be shown in **[Tracked Changes](/patterns/workflow/track-changes)**, so that it is clear to users what has happened.
