description: >-
    Your project allows machines/bots to contribute high volumes of data; fix errors and specific problems; and synchronise with other sources. But how can you balance the benefits of this with the risks of negative impact?  

How do I grow your database quickly with the least errors possible? 
context: >-
    Sometimes it i’s important to accelerate data acquisition and only machines can administerdo the necessary high-  volume of contributions. 
solution: >-
    Allow machines/bots for applications to push data directly into your database. Develop, publish and adhere to a ‘bot policy’ to set rules around the use of bots, and to mitigate any harmful impacts.

Bots are tools that can make amendments to databases without requiring a human to authorise a decision. Typically, bots can create entries; and add statements, labels and descriptions to existing entries. While bots can be hugely beneficial in terms of speed and volume of edits, they can be disruptive and damaging if the design or operation is not fit for purpose. If you allow bots to access your database, you should develop a ‘bot policy’.
