    Make clear what is required to accept a contribution, for example: 

    * Registering with the project
    * Installing specific software on machine or smartphone
    * Requiring specific credentials (eg university identity number, specific intranet access passwords etc)
    * Possessing artifacts or evidence (eg to add an entry to [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/search/), you would need all the sleeve note information from the album/CD etc)
problem: >-
    Contributors are not aware that they may need to prepare in order to make a contribution
context: >-
    A contributor is about to make their first submission and needs to know what information is required and what they should prepare in advance.

* The contributor might not have visited your site before, and barriers like installing software, or needing evidence can create friction and frustration. They may not complete the process and/or and may not return. 
* While your project may introduce requirements to help improve quality, the contributors may not be able//willing to prepare the required information.
