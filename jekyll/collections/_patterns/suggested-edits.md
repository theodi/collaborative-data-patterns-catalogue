Making individual fields and records **Visibly Editable** can encourage users to make small contributions, e.g. to fix data that has already been added to a record.

But if missing fields are not displayed to users when viewing a record, then they may not realise that data is missing or that it would be helpful to add it if they are able.

Implementing this pattern involves adding small prompts for users to improve an existing record: “This company is missing an address, can you add it?”.
