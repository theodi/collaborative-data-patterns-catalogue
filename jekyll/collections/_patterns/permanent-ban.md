A related sanction might be to reverse previous contributions.

Implementation of the ban will include thinking about:

* How to display that an account has been suspended
* Limiting the contributor’s ability to sign up with the same email/IP address again
* Limiting the contributor’s ability to participate in forums/communications.

Banning contributors is not trivial, it should be done in accordance with the **[Published Policies](/patterns/project-governance/published-policies)**.  Whatever the decision, it is vital to notify the contributor of the actions you are taking.
