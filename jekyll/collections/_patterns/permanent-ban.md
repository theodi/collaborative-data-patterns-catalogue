A related sanction might be to reverse previous contributions.

Whatever the decision, it is vital to notify the contributor of the actions you are taking. 

Banning contributors is not trivial, it should be done in accordance with the **Project Policies**.

Implementation of the ban will include thinking about:

* How to display that an account has been suspended
* Limiting the contributor’s ability to sign up with the same email/IP address again
* Limiting the contributor’s ability to participate in forums/communications.
