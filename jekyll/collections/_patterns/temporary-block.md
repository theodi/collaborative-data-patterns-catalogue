nav_order: 1
description: >-
    A contributor has contravened a policy and it is necessary to stop them from contributing for a short period of time.
context: >-
    A contributor has not adhered to a particular policy and ignored **[Warning Messages](/patterns/managing-conflict/warning-messages)**. The nature of the activity means that it requires investigation; or it is felt that the contributor would benefit from a cooling-off period.
solution: |
    Temporarily block the contributorâ€™s account. Inform them that their access to the project has been temporarily revoked and outline why that decision has been made.

Temporary blocks can be used to restrict changes to certain problem areas or topics, or the project may choose to prevent all further changes to the whole database.

Depending on the **[Published Policies](/patterns/project-governance/published-policies)**, project moderators may try to resolve the issue by communicating directly with the contributor.
