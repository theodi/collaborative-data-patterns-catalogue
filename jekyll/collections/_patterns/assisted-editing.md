    Create a system that will allow humans to verify contributions made by machines, whether they are bots or artificial intelligence (AI) machines.
problem: >-
    Your project allows machine contributions but you are unsure how to check that the contributions meet the standards required.
context: >-
    Machines and bots can initiate some project contributions which can include imported bulk data or  new entries/edits. It is important that there is human verification to check  that these records are correct, in line with the project’s schema and the standards.
examples:
    -

        description: >-
            OpenStreetMap and Facebook use machine learning to identify roads. The suggested amendments are not immediately added to the database. Instead the project uses a custom extendable tool as an interface to confirm if the machine-learning submission is correct. If correct, the contribution is added directly into the database.

This doesn’t mean that everything should be reviewed manually: programs/systems can be put in place to check and verify information automatically.

Think about this reviewing process before allowing machine participation and bulk uploads.

Anticipate on how machines will be participate in the project, via which systems, using which standardisation methods.
