    Contributors may not feel confident about successfully participating in your project, especially if they believe that they need some expert knowledge in order to contribute.
context: >-
    Potential contributors are considering joining the project, or have just joined and are trying to understand how to contribute.
solution: >-
    Signpost contributors to the simple ways they can make useful contributions immediately, which will help develop their understanding of the project as they go. Have a ‘start small’ philosophy and explain this to the contributors.

Even contributors with little experience can make valuable contributions early on and there are many ways of contributing something valuable to the project.

First time contributions to the project should be as simple as possible: ‘starting small’ will help build confidence and will be of more value to the project. Contributors will learn as they go and be confident in their submissions, which will make them more likely to keep contributing.

Contributors don’t usually know where to start on a project unless there is good signposting. It is therefore crucial to have highly visible start points. 

* Clear navigation
* Clear calls to action
* Explicit labeling (buttons, steps, actions…)

Even if all contributors are experienced/expert, projects should still provide guidance as they may be unfamiliar with the schemas and entry structures.

There are several patterns that can be employed at this stage depending on the type of project and tasks:

* Larger tasks can be split into smaller, easier to understand <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Microtasks</span>.
* Signpost smaller tasks such as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reporting Errors</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Suggested Edits</span>
* The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Onboarding</span> process can introduce new concepts and domain knowledge. 

Think carefully about how you give encouraging feedback to new members of your community, even if their first contribution cannot be accepted immediately.
