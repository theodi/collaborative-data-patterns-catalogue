title: Role Pathways
nav_order: 1
description: >-
    Your contributors are unsure if and how they can take on different roles within the project and can’t find information about how to increase their participation.
context: >-
    As contributors help and participate with the project, it’s important that they get a sense of reward, progress and acknowledgement from it. It is also important for the project that there are enough skilled contributors who are able to fulfil different roles.
solution: |-
    Provide a clear pathway so that people can progress from being complete new contributors to expert contributors.

    Expert user responsibilities can include::
    
    * training others
    * reviewing policies
    * helping with development 
    * reviewing others’ work
    * moderating community posts
    * contributing to high-level decisions
    * helping set new policies

Advertise that contributors can take on more responsibilities within the project to help contributors feel more engaged which might also encourage more participation.

Suggest new roles as they continue to contribute. Do not assign new roles without discussion and agreement, especially if participation is voluntary.

If some contributors are particularly passionate, expert, or active, then they could request an enhanced role, or the project could offer a new role to those contributors. This process could also be automatic within the system – see **[Automatically Acquire Privileges](/patterns/project-governance/automatically-acquire-privileges)**. 

Some projects don't need different tiers of contributors, eg if:

* all of the participants are experts in their field 
* the review process is the responsibility of external people (ie not active contributors)
* only administrators can act as moderators
