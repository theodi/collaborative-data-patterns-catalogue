Not all projects require **Mandatory Review**, but carrying out reviews of contributions can increase confidence of contributors. Contributors do not want to unintentionally introduce errors, so they may not submit a contribution if they do not have confidence in it.

Allowing a contributor to request that another contributor reviews their change provides an opportunity to introduce **Feedback Loops** into the workflow for maintaining your data.

A **Changeset **that has been flagged for reviewing might be immediately applied to the database, so the review is done retrospectively. Or it might go into a queue for reviewing before being applied.
