## Background

The ODI’s [innovation programme](https://theodi.org/project/research-and-development-of-data-innovation-for-uk-government/) launched in July 2017 to advance knowledge and expertise in how data can shape the next generation of services, and create economic growth. The funds for it were awarded through Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency, in a three-year programme, running to March 2020 with a funding profile of £2m each year.

The programme consists of a number of projects which are all aimed at advancing our understanding of the opportunities data can bring and some of the pitfalls to avoid. They are intended to enable the UK to build on its established strengths in data and data analytics, break new ground in creating value from data across industry, and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of data innovation globally.

This guidebook was produced as part of a project exploring collaborative approaches to collecting and stewarding datasets. Collaborative maintenance can help to share the costs of data collection and management across public and private sector organisations, supporting the creation of sustainable, trustworthy data infrastructure

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
In our project we:

*   [interviewed people involved in running and contributing to successful projects](https://theodi.org/article/insights-from-successful-collaborative-maintenance-projects/) that involve collaborative maintenance of data
*   [carried out desk research](https://theodi.org/article/collaborative-data-maintenance-how-can-we-enable-shared-curation-of-high-quality-data/) to learn more about the design, scope and governance of existing projects
*   directly participated in a variety of open projects to learn more about the practice of collaborative maintenance
</div>

We used the insights from this research to produce guidance on this website and create a collection of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">design patterns</span> to support those in developing new projects and improving existing services.

The website is openly licensed and we <span style="text-decoration:underline;">invite contributions from the community</span>.
