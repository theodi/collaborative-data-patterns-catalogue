# Track Changes 


## Problem

It is difficult to understand how a record came to be in its current or previous state.


## Context

Changes have been made to a record or set of records, which another contributor or user would like to understand.


## Solution

Create and display a log of **Changesets**, where each entry represents an amendment to a record.


## Discussion

Records may evolve through multiple amendments from different contributors.  Amendments can include:



*   Creation of a new record
*   Additions of new data to an existing record
*   Removal of data from an existing record
*   Deletion of a record
*   Reverts: undoing a previous change

Knowing the history of changes to a record is useful in a number of circumstances,for example:



*   To inform decisions about its future
*   To understand activity in a record, perhaps to resolve disputes
*   To assess the implications of accepting or reverting a specific change
*   To find out about the evolution of a record, or a set of records, including the whole database
*   To analyse patterns of behaviour, from either a record or database level

By keeping a log of changes and associating them with records, the history of a record and a project can be displayed, for moderators and contributors to view.

# Gamify Contributions


## Problem

Contributors are not engaging with the project.


## Context

Contributors are not making many contributions. This low level of engagement with the project is resulting in slow progress being made towards the project’s goals.


## Solution

Introduce game design elements as features within the project website, as a means to motivate regular engagement with the project.


## Discussion

There are a variety of ways to motivate contributors to contribute to a project. 

If you **Know Your Community** you should have some insight into their needs and interests. Creating a strong, collaborative environment, where you use **Feedback Loops** and **Acknowledge Contributions**, will help the community feel valued.

You can also try to **Deliver Individual Value** as a more direct means of encouraging contributors to complete useful tasks.

[Gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) is a means of motivating contributions by introducing game design ideas into your project’s website. Game elements could include:



*   Awarding points for carrying out certain tasks, such as adding new data or completing reviews
*   Giving badges to mark specific achievements, for example for being a regular contributor, contributing a specific number of records, or participating in an organised campaign
*   Creating leaderboards that highlight the most frequent contributors

Creating a project or campaign **Progress Indicator** can be considered a form of gamification, as it may motivate increased activity towards completing specific goals.

While gamification has been successfully applied in a number of collaborative projects, it’s important to recognise the potential downsides. For example, a leaderboard might end up incentivising people to make lots of contributions, regardless of whether they are useful or high quality. Make sure game elements are designed with care to ensure they incentivise the right behaviour among contributors.
