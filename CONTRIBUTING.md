# Collaborative Data Patterns Contributor Guidelines

This repository is home for the software and content used to publish the 
Open Data Institute [Collaborative Data Patterns](https://collaborative-data.theodi.org/) 
website. 

By contributing to the project you can help us to build out a useful 
guidebook of patterns and other guidance to help people design and build tools 
for collaboratively maintaining data.

The website provides some background about [how to contribute](https://collaborative-data.theodi.org/contribute/)

But essentially, there are two ways in which you can help us improve the guidebook. 

## Improving the software

Firstly you can help us to improve and maintain the software used to generate the site.

The site is built using the Jekyll static site generator and a number of supporting 
tools.

We are happy to accept bug reports, bug fixes or improvements to the site layout 
that will ensure that it is accessible and useful for as many people as possible.

## Improving the content

Secondly, you can help us to improve the content of the website by correcting 
typos, suggesting improvements to the current content or by proposing new 
patterns.

## Submitting improvements

In both cases you suggest that you first submit an issue to outline your proposed 
changes so, if necessary, we can discuss the changes with you.

However simple bug fixes or spelling corrections can be directly submitted as a 
pull request. Please provide a comment to help us review changes.

To help us review submissions, please tag your issue using the appropriate label.

Also bear in mind that in submitting software or content changes you are agreeing 
to the terms of the MIT and CC-BY-SA licences.
